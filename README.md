Hello! This was a fun challenge! Please enjoy the website!

Libraries I've used: 
- Chakra UI, general UI library
- NextJS, just a framework I like.
- FuseJS, for fuzzy search
- cities.json, for city information,
- react-query, for queries
- Tailwind, I hate writing CSS.

This can be improved in the future. I honestly cut corners as I was in much of a hurry today; I could've made a separate UI for desktop but I found this one works fine. I should also put the city dictionary on a server somewhere rather than query it locally, but it gets downloaded and indexed once so that's fine. 
Apologies on the colors; coding is my strong suit, not graphics. 

This needs no deployment steps just run next build to run it locally or visit the website I've provided @ https://weather-e36th51xz-noahdavon.vercel.app/
Thank you for your time and consideration!
